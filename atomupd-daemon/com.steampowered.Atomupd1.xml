        VersionsAvailable:

        Map of available update IDs (i.e. version number) to their keys and

        updates or if `CheckForUpdates` has not been called yet.

        The values of this map are vardicts that include the following keys:
        <variablelist>

            <term>variant s</term>

        VersionsAvailableLater:

        Map of available update IDs (i.e. version number) to their keys and
        values. These updates can't be directly installed because they require
        a base system version that is newer than the current one.
        It is an empty map if either there aren't any available
        later updates or if `CheckForUpdates` has not been called yet.

        The values of this map are the same as for `VersionsAvailable`,
        plus additional vardicts with the following keys:
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>requires s</term>
            <listitem><para>
              Version ID that must be installed before this update.
            </para></listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>

        Please note that here the key `estimated_size` represents the estimated
        download size, under the assumption that the update will be performed
        with a system running the version specified in the `requires` key.
    -->
    <property name="VersionsAvailableLater" type="a{sa{sv}}" access="read"/>

    <!--
        CurrentVersion:

        String representing the system version that is currently in use.

    <property name="CurrentVersion" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!--
        CheckForUpdates:
        @options: Vardict with configuration options
        @versions_available: Map of available update IDs to their keys and values
        @versions_available_later: Map of available update IDs, to their keys and
          values, that require a newer system version

        Supported keys in the @options vardict include:
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>variant s</term>
            <listitem><para>
              Desired update variant. Possible values include `steamdeck` and

            </para></listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>

        If @options doesn't include the key `variant`, its value will be taken
        from the steamos-atomupd manifest JSON file.

        At least one update is available, for the current system version, when
        @versions_available is not the empty map.

        For more information about the content of @versions_available and
        @versions_available_later, please refer to the description of the
        properties `VersionsAvailable` and `VersionsAvailableLater` respectively.
